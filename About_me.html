			<h1>On this page you can find some information about me.</h1>
			<p>Let me introduce myself, my name is Roman, I'm 22 years old.</p>
			<p>I got a full higher education in Chernigov National Technological University, Mechanical
 Engineering department. At the University my favorite subjects were mathematics, physics, mechanical drawing, and 
computer science. At school I also liked these items.</p>
			<p>I want to be software tester. I read book about testing: Roman Savin "Testing dot com", 
generally this book is about the testing theory, and cases of life testers, the book is written very interesting 
and humorous.</p> 
			<p>In this book I got understanding and knowledge of life cycle software, understanding of
 the goals and objectives of the testing process and the testing phases. Also I found understanding the life cycle
 of bugs, basic knowledge of the methods, models and types of testing. Also I read the book: Testing object-oriented
 software. A Practical Guide by John McGregor and David Cicse.</p>
			<p>Web development also is interesting subject for me. I read book Prohorenyuka "set of web 
masters". I did on-line course on HTML and CSS. In my spare time I develop my website.</p>
			<p>I am sociable, diligent, responsible, attentive to details, interested in new technologies
 and a fast learner.</p>
			<p>I`m looking forward to meet new challenges, and get new experience in QA.</p>
